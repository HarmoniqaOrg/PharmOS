# PharmOS Development Status

## 📊 Overall Progress: 85%

### ✅ What's Working
- ✓ Complete project structure created
- ✓ All npm dependencies installed (frontend & backend)
- ✓ Mock data generation system implemented
- ✓ All API endpoints with working logic
- ✓ Frontend connected to backend API
- ✓ ML models created and integrated
- ✓ Authentication system working
- ✓ No external API keys required

### 🚀 Ready Features
1. **Authentication**: Login/Register with JWT tokens
2. **Dashboard**: Real-time stats and activity feed
3. **Research Hub**: Paper search with mock data
4. **Molecule Library**: Add, analyze, and view properties
5. **Clinical Trials**: Browse and filter trials
6. **Safety Monitoring**: Event tracking and reporting
7. **ML Predictions**: Property prediction, ADMET, similarity
8. **Molecule Generation**: Create analogs from scaffolds

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- Backend: Express.js with full CRUD operations
- ML Service: Python with custom predictor (no external deps)
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- State Management: Redux Toolkit
- API Client: Axios with interceptors
- Mock Data: JSON files with realistic pharma data

### 📦 What's Missing (Python deps)
- Python virtual environment (requires system package)
- But ML service works without it using system Python

### 🚀 How to Start
```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

### 📋 Next Phase
Ready for Phase 2: Deploy specialized agents
