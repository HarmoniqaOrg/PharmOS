# PharmOS Automated Merge Strategy

## 🤖 Autonomous Merge Criteria

### Auto-Merge Conditions
A PR will be automatically merged when ALL of the following are met:

1. **✅ All CI Checks Pass**
   - Unit tests: 100% pass rate
   - Integration tests: 100% pass rate
   - Linting: No errors
   - Type checking: No errors
   - Build: Successful

2. **📊 Code Quality Metrics**
   - Test coverage: ≥70% (or improves existing coverage)
   - No security vulnerabilities
   - Performance benchmarks: No regression >10%
   - Bundle size: <5% increase

3. **🏷️ PR Labels**
   - Has `ready-to-merge` label
   - No `needs-review` label
   - No `blocked` label
   - No `breaking-change` label

4. **🔄 Merge Order Priority**
   1. `feature/testing-suite` - Tests merge first
   2. `feature/devops-monitoring` - Infrastructure next
   3. `feature/api-graphql` - API changes
   4. `feature/ml-enhancement` - ML features
   5. `feature/frontend-polish` - UI last to avoid conflicts

### Manual Review Required
- Breaking changes to public APIs
- Database schema modifications
- Security-related changes
- Dependencies updates
- Changes to CI/CD pipeline

## 🔀 Conflict Resolution

### Automatic Resolution
```yaml
# File precedence for auto-resolution
1. *.test.*, *.spec.* → Testing agent wins
2. infrastructure/* → DevOps agent wins
3. ml/* → ML agent wins
4. frontend/src/* → Frontend agent wins
5. src/api/* → API agent wins
```

### Merge Strategies by File Type
- **Documentation (.md)**: Combine both versions
- **Package files**: Merge dependencies, latest version wins
- **Config files**: DevOps agent version takes precedence
- **Test files**: Keep all tests from both branches

## 📋 Pre-Merge Checklist

### Automated Checks
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] PR has been open for at least 30 minutes
- [ ] At least 2 successful builds
- [ ] No ongoing deployments
- [ ] Branch is up-to-date with main

### Post-Merge Actions
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run smoke tests
3. Update agent status dashboard
4. Notify other agents of changes
5. Create follow-up tasks if needed

## 🚨 Escalation to Human

Only escalate when:
1. Same file modified by 3+ agents
2. Circular dependency detected
3. Production deployment fails
4. Security vulnerability critical/high
5. Customer data models changed

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

Every successful merge updates:
- Conflict resolution patterns
- Test coverage requirements
- Performance baselines
- Integration test suite
